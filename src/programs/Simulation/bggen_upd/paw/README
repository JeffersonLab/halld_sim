BGGEN can write out the paw ntuples (see the key WROUT).

Using paw to study the output:
  $cd paw
  $ln -s ../run/bggen.nt .  # attach the ntuple you need
  $paw
  PAW>exec example_1.kumac  # uses the ntuple name ./bggen.nt

A code to read the output binary file bggen.dat:
  $cd ../paw/
  $ make
  $ ./bgg_read.exe
