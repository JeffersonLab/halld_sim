   This directory contains the code and tools to generate the photoproduction
   of hadronic events in a wide energy range of E>0.15 GeV, matching the total
   photoproduction cross section. It can be used to calculate the hadronic
   background for GLUEX etc. It also can simulate exclusive binary processes,
   for example gamma+p --> J/psi+p.

   A detailed writeup can be found in:
   doc/bggen-manual.org
   The file is readable as is, but also can be converted to html using the
   emacs org package, typically already installed. The html file provides
   hyperlinks, "rich text" etc. Depending on the org version one can do:
   $cd doc
   $emacs bggen-manual.org --batch -f org-export-as-html --kill # older org version <=7
   $emacs bggen-manual.org --batch -f org-html-export-to-html --kill # newer org version
